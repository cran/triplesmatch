# triplesmatch 1.1.0 07/26/2024

* Fixed a bug when triples matching within very small strata (only one treated or one control individual)
* Fixed a bug in make_bal_tab() when not all treated units are matched. Note that the new value of the function has one additional column for the mean of the matched treated units.
* Minor updates to error messages and documentation

# triplesmatch 1.0.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
